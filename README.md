# Internal Product Management Resources
All the resources I've found useful as Platform Product Manager aka an "Internal PM". Why are internal experiences important you ask? Ever joined a new company and started poking around their internal tools with a bit of disgust on your face? Employees are users too! Engineers are solving such complicated problems, don't make their lives harder with a poorly design internal tool that goes down every few days. I have always felt that treating your internal products with as much attention as your external ones can have huge returns on investement and make the lives of your employees easier and more enjoyable/

# Types of Internal Product Management 

## Platform as a Product
Platform Product Management is the productization of the engineering Platform. As a Platform PM, your customers are any type of engineer or technical user who needs to build, maintain, and operate software with limited cognitive load or disruption. Platform Product can sometimes be a bit tricky as it sometimes does not have a front end or UI; as a Platform PM you may be working with CLI tools, documentation, api specs, and experiences that are more nested within an engineers local environment. This makes user research and customer empathy even more critical to get the product right.

### Podcasts 
- [Spotify's Platform Product Story](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iuQ3ew1Wwpuiq6LbBKzCl?si=5b15eaa27a014851) THISSS is this ultimate platform product success story, I love that they were taking a look at how fast they were onboarding engineers as a north star for themselves, 'are we successfully integrating  new engineers and are they productive quickly?' This is also an amazing example of how important senior leadership buy in is.  
- [Shopify's Take on the Strategic Power of Platforms to Drive Growth and Innovation](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hl3Fws7Yg2mU1LapA7PI4?si=25cdaa724fee436e) Although this podcast highlights an example of a platform that Shopify monetizes, the ideas and insights are very applicable to internal PM's looking at the same types of customers. The story of how Brandon built his own niche of Product Management is also an interesting listen for those looking to find their own flavor of product
- [Measuring and Managing Community Orgs,Developer Relations and Beyond](https://open.spotify.com/episode/57gbJ9n9XuNdOZxjB8jVt1?si=d7cdedfb12584568) How does one measure the success of open source communities? This is a challenging question that A16oz tackles in this super insightful podcasts about whether developer relations is the right decision for your product. Again with this one, the product is external and the use cases are about companies that have strong developer facing products, but the insights are still applicabable for internal platform products. 
- [Backstage: Spotify Developer Portals with Stefan Ã…lund](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5OEUKrremK3iLOhDVj4rgk?si=ZxIjeAISS9WKS4zZP5Z7kg&dl_branch=1) Honestly, when I first came across Backstage, I shed a tear. This product is the gold standard for how Platform Product thinking should look and be treated within an organization. From the product itself, to Stefan's journey getting buy-in from senior leadership and convincing his entire org that this is a problem worth solving with high return on investemnet. Just so. well. done. Eternally grateful to you Spotify for backstage.
